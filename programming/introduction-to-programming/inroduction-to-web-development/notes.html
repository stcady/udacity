        <p>As best you can try to explain what <em>markup</em> is.</p>

        <p>
            Mary had a little toad<br>
            Its skin as tough as shell<br>
            And every file that toad would write<br>
            It used HTML.<br>
        </p>

        <p>This is a story. Add paragraph tags to make it better.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time there was a baby tiger named Talia. Talia lived in a fearsome jungle in the middle of the fearsome jungle. Talia was the most fearsome of all, though she was only a baby.</p>
